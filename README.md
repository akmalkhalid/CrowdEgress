# CrowdEgress

The source code was intially written in Python 2.7, and you need to slightly modify the code if you want to run it in python3. Pygame and Numpy are required to run the code. 

How-To: python main.py --> user interface (GUI) --> select input files --> visulize geometry settings --> start simulation

Group Social Force is implemented with Interactive Opinion Dynamics. This model is an extension of the social force model introduced by Helbing and Moln√°r (1995) and Helbing, Farkas, and Vicsek (2000). The model aims at investigating protypes of pedestrian behavior in crowd evacuation. 

The program computes how each agent interacts with other entities including surrounding agents, walls, doors and exits.  Please refer to .csv file for details in specification of agents, walls, doors and exits.  

### Collaborators are needed and your ideas are much valued!  


If you are a student or researcher who want to use this python package to test your own model or algorithm, please feel free to ask your question either by email or issue trackers, and I am glad to guide you to use this package!  

So if you are interested in this project and would like to contribute your ideas, please feel free to start an issue to propose your ideas!  Collaboration is welcome and comments are appreciated!  There are several things to do to improve the source code and document.  Please refer to the issue "To-do list" for details.  

Open discussion is much encouraged about the model and algorithm!  
Source code keeps changing but the model does not!
