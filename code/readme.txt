Please use code version 2.0
Please run the command python ui.py to start GUI and select the input files.  

When GUI screen is activated, please select the input files for the simulation.  Users can optionally use .fds file to create the compartment geometry, and the pedestrian features are described in .csv file.  If .fds file is omitted, the compartment geometry is described in .csv file.  Please take a look at the examples for details.  If you try .fds file, please only keep one main evacuation mesh in .fds file, which means there is only one floor in simulaiton.
